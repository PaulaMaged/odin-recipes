In this project I have applied the tools to
- use common html elements to structure a webpage 
- add a/an heading, paragraph, emphasis, strong, ordered/unordered lists, title a tab and create comments 
- add images and hyperlinks with added attributes like target and rel
- use git to add, commit and push to remote repository
